If you want to set an authentication system like jwt, then you have to store your token inside the client(browser). You store them either in localStorage or as a cookie. But when you perform any kind of server-side operation, then you don't have access to the client. So you can't access the cookies from the server-side. Then what is the solution?

### The solution.

```typescript
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
  const { req, res } = ctx;

  const { cookies } = req;

  return { props: {} };
};
```

I have created a YouTube video about this. You can check that out. If you like this video, please like and subscribe to my channel.

You can access the cookies from the request object inside the `getServerSideProps` data fetching method. You can learn about data fetching methods of nextjs from [ here ](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering).

`getServerSideProps` method takes context as a parameter. A context is a giant object. Request and Response object is inside the context object.

```typescript
const { req, res } = ctx;
```

In the `request` object you'll find a `cookies` object.

```typescript
const { cookies } = req;
```

All your cookies will be inside the `cookies` object.

So that's it for this blog.
